My django website
=================

My django website is a side project of mine to deepen my 
knowledge in Django and in general webdeveloment, to understand how 
to deploy from development to production, how to secure my
website and to get my hands dirty with some simple but honest work. 
But first and foremost to have fun developing a project!


Expected features
-----------------

- A blog build with django
	- For this application I will use [Fefes Blog](https://blog.fefe.de) as a blueprint and his talk about [writing secure software](https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-11811-writing_secure_software) at the [37C3](https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2023) as a guide for security measurements. 


Installation
------------

Installation under the assumption that you:
- are working on a Linux machine
- have Python installed (usually goes hand in hand with first requirement)
- have the python package venv installed for isolating the project

you can install this project 
by cloning this repo and then running:

```sh
# Creating a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activating the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Installing required software
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
